# Inventory-Management-System-in-C

This repository contains the c code for Inventory Management System of a store. 
This mini project was done by a group of 4 student including myself during my Sem 2 on 28 April 2021. 
In this mini project the user can enter new product details, print the list of products, search for the product, buy the desired quantity of the desired product and lastly the manager can delete the product.
This mini project was made using the concepts of Data Structures in C.
